**Here are some important definitions to help you understand our terms and this Privacy Policy:**

## 1. Information we collect

We collect information when you provide it to us, when you use our Website or Services, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below.

**Account Creation:** When you create an account or otherwise use the Services, we collect information such as your name, email address, password, role within your team or enterprise, and an optional profile photo.

**Your Communications with Us:** We collect information from you such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter, request customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us. We also collect the contents of messages or attachments that you may send to us, as well as other information you choose to provide, and that may be associated with your communications.

**Payment Information:** When you purchase a subscription to the Services, you will need to provide payment information (e.g., financial account details, shipping information) to process your subscription. We use third-party payment providers to process payments on the Services.

**Surveys:** We may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include contact information and other information about you.

**Interactive Features:** We may offer interactive features such as forums, blogs, chat and messaging services, and social media pages. We and others who use our Website or Services may collect the information you submit or make available through these interactive features. Any content you provide via the public sections of these features will be considered “public” and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. By using these interactive features, you understand that the information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for their own purposes.

**Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests:** We may run sweepstakes and contests. Contact information you provide may be used to inform you about the sweepstakes or contest and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes.

**Job Applications**. We may post job openings and opportunities on the Website or Services. If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to assess your qualifications.

**B. Information Collected Automatically**

**Automatic Data Collection:** We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with our Website or Services. This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device, location information (including inferred general location based off of your IP address), Internet service provider, pages that you visit before, during and after using the Website or Services, information about the links you click, information about how you interact with the Website or Services, including the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use the Website or Services. Information we collect may be associated with accounts and other devices.

**Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information:** We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Website or Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your devices that allow us and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.  For more information regarding these Technologies, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.notion.so/Cookie-Notice-bc186044eed5488a8387a9e94b14e58c?pvs=21).

**Analytics:** We may also use third-party service providers to collect and process analytics and other information on our Website or Services. These third-party service providers may use Technologies to collect and store analytics and other information. They have their own privacy policies addressing how they use the analytics and other information and we do not have access to, nor control over, third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.  For more information regarding third-party cookies, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.notion.so/Cookie-Notice-bc186044eed5488a8387a9e94b14e58c?pvs=21).

**Advertising:** In using the Website or Services, we may allow select third party advertising technology partners to place Technologies on the browser of your device to collect information about you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers) may use this information to serve relevant content and advertising to you as you browse the Internet, and access their own Technologies on your browser to assist in this activity. If you are interested in more information about these online advertising activities, and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/), or [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. You can also opt out of certain online advertising activities by following the instructions in the "Your Choices" and "Your Privacy Rights" sections below. Please note that if you use these mechanisms, you may still see advertising on our Website or Services or across the Internet, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.

**C. Information from Other Sources**

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations. For example, if you access our Website or Services through a third-party application, such as a social networking site or a third-party login service, we may collect information about you from that third party that you have made available via your privacy settings. In addition, if you register a Notion account or associate a Notion account with an email address provisioned by your organization, we may obtain information from third party data enrichment providers to help us to better tailor business-to-business marketing and sales outreach to you.

Should you choose to use the Google Contacts feature within our Services, we will have the ability to view your contacts via the Google People API. The sole use of this data is to populate the auto-completion of your contacts when sending invitation emails. Notion will not use this data for any other purpose.

Notion Calendar requires you to authorize access to your calendar and events data held in your third party calendar service. Such third party calendar service is a Non-Notion Service as that term is defined in the Agreement. Should you choose to authorize an integration with your calendar provider, we will store your userID for that calendar provider and the authorization token to connect to the calendar provider’s API to give you the ability to use Notion Calendar to store, view and edit data from your calendars, and autocomplete contacts when you create events.

You may also choose to integrate Notion Calendar with your third party conferencing provider. Such conferencing provider is a Non-Notion Service as that term is defined in the Agreement. Should you choose to authorize an integration with your conference provider, you will have the ability to add conferencing meetings to your calendar events, and to view and store any information associated with conferencing meeting invitations in Notion Calendar.
